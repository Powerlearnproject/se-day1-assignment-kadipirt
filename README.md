Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1)Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the application of engineering principles in order to build, test, deploy and maintain software applications.
**importance**
Software engineering applies testing and quality assurance techniques to minimize bugs and failures.
Helps build systems that can handle increasing users and data loads.
Implementing cybersecurity principles protects software from vulnerabilities and attacks.

2)Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
**Birth of software enginnering**
The term software engineering was first introduced in 1968 in Germany during the Nato Software Engineering Conference.
It marked the beginning of treating software engineering as an engineering principle rather than just coding.
**Rise of Agile methodologies(2001 - Agile Manifesto)**
A group of software developers published the Agile Manifesto.
It involved a flexible, iterative approach that focused on collaboration and user interaction.
**Emerge of cloud computing and DevOps(2010-till present)**
Rise of cloud platforms such as Microsoft Azure, AWS and Google Cloud that changed software development and scalability.
DevOps culture emerged by enabling collaboration between the development team and the operations team to enable continuous integration and delivery.

3)List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
**planning and requirement analysis**
iIdentify scope, purpose and feasilbility of the project.
Gather and analyze user requirements.
**System Design**
Define software components, modules and interactions
Choose the technology stack.
**Implementation**
Developing the system by writing code
**Testing**
identify and fix bugs, vulnerabilities and perfomance issues.
perfom unit testing, integration testing and security testing.
**Deployment**
Release the software product for public or private use.
Deploy on cloud servers, app stores or block-chain networks.
**Maintenance and updates**
Fix bugs, enhance features and optimize perfomance.
Gather user feedback for improvements.

4)Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is linear and sequential while Agile methodology is iterative and incremental.
waterfall mehthodolgy is appropriate where the project is predicatble and change is minimal e.g.,Government projects with strict regulatory compliance.
agile methodology is appropriate where the project has fast-changing requirements and is customer-driven e.g,mobile apps and web development.

5)Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - Writes and maintains the code that powers the application.
**responsibilities**
Debugs and fixes issues to ensure smooth functionality
Writes clean, efficient, and maintainable code using programming languages
Collaborates with other developers, UI/UX designers, and testers

Quality Assurance Engineer - Ensures the software meets quality standards before deployment.
**responsibilities**
Designs and executes test plans and test cases to identify bugs.
Ensures the software functions correctly on different platforms and devices.
Works closely with developers to fix bugs and performance issues

Project Manager - Oversees the software development process, ensuring project success.
**responsibilities**
Defines project scope, timeline, and budget.
Assigns tasks and monitors progress.
Identifies and mitigates risks.
nsures software meets business goals and client expectations.

6)Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
**importance of IDEs**
Error Detection & Debugging – Built-in debuggers assist in identifying and fixing errors quickly.
Code Efficiency & Productivity – Features like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and debugging help developers write code faster.
Project Management – Allows organizing files, dependencies, and configurations efficiently.
examples: visual studio, Remix IDE
**Importance of VCS**
Collaboration & Teamwork – Enables multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts.
Change Tracking & History – Maintains a record of all changes, making it easy to revert to previous versions if needed.
Backup & Recovery – Protects against accidental deletions or overwrites.
example: GitHub, Bitbucket

7)What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
**managing complex codebases**
following a modular programming approach
**debugging and fixing bugs**
follow test driven development to minimize errors
**Keeping Up with Rapid Technological Changes**
Engage in open-source projects and hackathons.
Stay updated by reading blogs, taking courses, and attending tech conferences.

8)Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
**unit testing**-testing of components or functions of the software in isolation
importance
ensures each unit works as expected
saves time by preventin issues that would occur later

**integration testing**-tests the interaction between different components and services.
importance
identifies communication issues betwen modules.
prevents integration failures when combining APIs, databases and microservices.
ensures correct data flow between components.

**system testing**-tests the entire application as a whole to ensure its compliance with the requirements
importance
ensures the software meets user and business requirements
identifies scalability and perfomance issues.
establishes whether the application perfoms as required in real life situations

**acceptance testing**-validates whether the system meets customer expectations and buiness needs.
importance
ensures system solves the intended problem for users
catches usability issues before launching.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


9)Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

prompt engineering-practice of crafting effective inputs to optimize AI model responses.
**importance**
lead to more context-aware and well structured responses.
improves Human-AI collaboration

10)Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

vague propmt-=tell me about space"
improved prompt="Describe the structure of the universe, including galaxies, black holes, and dark matter, and explain their significance in modern astrophysics."
 the improved prompt is more specific - focuses on key topics such as galaxies.
 the improved prompt is concise and direct- this eliminates vagueness and this ensures a more informative answer.
 the improved prompt has made it clear what is expected of the response-it asks for both description and significance.
